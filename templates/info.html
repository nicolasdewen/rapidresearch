                    RapidResearch was designed to make life easier for investors without access to large amounts of institutional data.
                    Even when this data can be obtained it is like opening the floodgates, with an endless torrent of information coming our way.
                    By making use of a variety of finance API's and an array of endpoints; RapidResearch gathers
                    the most commonly used metrics used in evaluating companies for a specific ticker.
                </h5>

                <h5>
                    All the user has to do is punch in the ticker and the program outputs a report on the company. To make things easier for users,
                    the calculations for the more complicated figures are included in popovers, simply click on any of them to find
                    out more about the calculations used and market averages/target ranges. I acknowledge there may be certain biases evident
                    as despite most conventionally used metrics being included, there are certain figures that I am accustomed to which led to their inclusion.
